- project: Games ML
  role: Machine Learning

    Game ML is an experiment to apply machine learning to create a different recommendations algorithm,
    instead to be based on what people like it uses natural language processing to find similar item that people
    speak in similar manner, regardless of how they like that item. <br/>
    <br/>
    The algorithm is quite effective and is able to find items categories without training them.<br/>
    <br/>
    The example use a game reviews database but has not been update in years.<br/>
